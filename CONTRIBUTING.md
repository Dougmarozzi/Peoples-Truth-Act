# Contributing to the People's Truth Act (PTA)

Thank you for helping us build the "Titanium Standard" for government accountability. The PTA is an open-source framework designed to prove that government auditing can be done at **$0 taxpayer cost**.

## 🛠 How You Can Help
We are looking for expertise in:
1. **The Ledger (SHA-256):** Developing the logic for immutable transaction hashing.
2. **The Bumper Program:** Coding automated spending thresholds that trigger mandatory FIC audits.
3. **Financial Logic:** Refining the "20% Integrity Fee" clawback math for fiscal self-sufficiency.
4. **Documentation:** Improving the "Fiscal Self-Sufficiency Report" templates for Congressional use.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repo:** Create your own copy of the project on GitHub.
2. **Branching:** Always create a new branch for your work (e.g., `feature/bumper-logic`).
3. **Commits:** Use clear, present-tense messages (e.g., `feat: add SHA-256 hash validation`).

## ⚖️ Standards & Ethics
* **Transparency First:** All code must be readable and documented. No "black box" logic.
* **Non-Partisan:** The PTA is a tool for accountability, not a political weapon.
