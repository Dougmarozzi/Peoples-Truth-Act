FIC Fiscal Self-Sufficiency Report
Executive Summary
This report serves as formal proof to Congress that the Federal Integrity Commission (FIC) operates as a self-sustaining entity. In alignment with the People's Truth Act, the FIC requires zero taxpayer funding [cite: 02-04-2026].

Revenue Model
The FIC is funded exclusively through the following mechanisms:

Integrity Fees: A 20% "Bumper Program" fee is applied to all fines and recovered assets [cite: 11-22-2025, 10-10-2025].

Self-Sustaining Operations: These fees cover all technical overhead, including the maintenance of the SHA-256 Ledger and the Bumper Program infrastructure [cite: 02-04-2026].

Taxpayer Protection
Zero General Fund Reliance: No funds shall be drawn from the United States Treasury or general taxpayer revenue [cite: 02-04-2026].

Public Accountability: All financial flows are recorded on the open-source ledger for real-time auditing by the public and the DOGE team.
