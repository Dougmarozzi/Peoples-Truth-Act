REVISION TO SECTION 3: THE DUTY OF INQUIRY
Purpose: To eliminate the "Plausible Deniability" defense by establishing legal presumptions of knowledge based on available technical data.
I. UPDATED DEFINITION: RECKLESS DISREGARD & RED FLAGS
A Public Official acts with "Reckless Disregard" if they certify a Covered Statement despite the existence of one or more Objective Red Flags. These include, but are not limited to:
    1. Automated System Alerts: Any "critical error," "data discrepancy," or "integrity failure" notification generated by federal technical systems or the Federal Truth Archive digital ledger.
    2. Internal Audit Warnings: Formal written or digital notifications from agency IG offices, GAO discrepancy reports, or lower-level technical supervisors flagging inaccuracies.
    3. Algorithmic Dissent: Any automated data output that contradicts the official’s summary or budget request.
II. THE "HEAD-IN-THE-SAND" SHIELD (CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE)
    • Willful Blindness: The deliberate avoidance of looking at available digital ledger data, SHA-256 hash verifications, or internal audit logs before signing a budget or certification shall be legally equivalent to Actual Knowledge.
    • Legal Presumption: If an Objective Red Flag was delivered to the official’s office or dashboard, the law shall presume the official had knowledge of the fraud. The burden of proof shifts to the official to prove a "systemic delivery failure" beyond their control.
